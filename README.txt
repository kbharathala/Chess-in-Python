Brief Description of Project Goals/Features:
I attempted to make two player chess using the tkinter module.

There is a piece class which has subclasses for each of the types of pieces and each type of piece has a "isValidMove" method which determines where it can move. This is the magic methods that have been implemented.

The entire game is run through chess.py which creates the board and handles the moves. The game board is made of buttons which light up when they are clicked, and can be de-selected.

Check is now implemented, so that illegal moves are prevented from happening. When there is a checkmate, it is printed out to the terminal

Features: 
1) Player cannot move twice
2) Background hihglights when button is clicked
3) Logs the moves in chess notation and prints it out to the terminal.
4) Can only capture your opponents pieces.
5) Move Validation works!!

Instructions to run:
Chess.py needs to be run using Python3.
